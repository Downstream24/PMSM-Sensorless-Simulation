# PMSM-Simulink
A conventional double PI closed loop(speed loop, current loop)  permanent magnet synchronous motor control simulation based on Matlab Simulink.
The motor electromechanical parameters mechanical parameters  and the control parameters can be set in the ParameterSetting.m files.

PS:All mathematical models are built based on mathematical models, and the simulation of multiple three-phase motors can be built by copying the submodules of multiple motors.
