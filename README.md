# PMSM-Simulink
A conventional double PI closed loop(speed loop, current loop)  permanent magnet synchronous motor control simulation based on Matlab Simulink.
The motor electromechanical parameters mechanical parameters  and the control parameters can be set in the ParameterSetting.m files.
This model is run and tested in Matlab 2019b.If you use a lower version of Matlab,please contact me by e-mail:liuzirui2018@163.com

PS:

1.This simulation is based on one 131kW interior permanent magnet synchronous motors.

2.All mathematical models are built based on mathematical models. So it's a purely linear model, and it doesn't take into account any nonlinear states or magnetic field coupling states

3.The simulation of multiple three-phase motors can be built by copying the submodules of multiple motors.
